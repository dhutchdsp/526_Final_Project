# 526_Final_Project
Code Artifact for 526 Final Project

radio_receiver.py and radio_sender.py were provided with the LoRa Equipment. I just changed them to transmit packets more frequently and record the location that the packet was received.

parseData.py was a simple script that I wrote that would read through all output from the receiver program and filter out all duplicated GPS points in order to make the maps more readable.

This project didn't rely on a lot of coding/implementation and instead was mostly focused on the experimentaion side of things.
